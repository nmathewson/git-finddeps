git-finddeps

THIS IS A HORRIBLE KLUDGE.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CODE, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

Here's a little program to find out which git commits in a branch depend on
one another.  Let's say that Alice gets a branch from Bob and wants to learn
how much she can refactor it.  She fetches Bob's branch, and then says:
    "git-finddeps.py master bob/newbranch"

After some chugging, it tells her:

Hey! Only two of these commits actually depend on anything else. It looks
like 374621535 -> 8b081231b -> d827a5495a is a sequence of dependencies, and
the other commits could be reordered freely.

Right now it runs pretty slow (not O(2^N) but it feels like it), and does
badly with some branch structures, and only looks at the output of
git-cherry-pick to see if a sequence is valid.



TODO:
  - Make the code not suck.
  - Take compilation into account
  - Try to make the heuristics faster
  - Better output format
  - Cache intermediate results
  - Find better options than cherry-pick
